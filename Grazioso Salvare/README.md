  	Grazioso Salvare is a company focused on animal rescue operations, requiring efficient and adaptable software solutions to manage and visualize animal data from shelters. Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs is crucial for such projects, especially when developing a CRUD Python module to connect dashboard widgets to a database. This module encapsulates database interactions, making the code modular and easier to update or extend without altering the entire system. This approach offered several advantages, such as simplifying the connection between the front-end and back-end, ensuring data integrity, and allowing for easy adaptation of the module in future projects. For instance, this CRUD module could be reused or expanded to handle other types of data, support additional queries, or integrate with different databases. This execution differed from previous projects in maintaining more modularity in the code so it could be more easily adapted based on how the requirements from the customer changed and grew. Previous work was more singular in direct in approach, not offering as much scalability to the code.
  
 	 As a computer scientist, problem-solving involves breaking down complex requirements into manageable tasks and addressing each component. In the Grazioso Salvare project, the approach differed by focusing on integrating data processing with user interface elements, ensuring a positive user experience on the front end. Techniques like modular design, clear documentation, and iterative testing were crucial in meeting the clientâ€™s needs. For future projects, I would prioritize early requirement gathering if possible and designing with more scalability in mind to create databases that are robust and tailored to specific client requests. This project changed over the course of this course and designing the project with the end product in mind from the beginning would change the initial approach that was taken with those end goals in mind. Computer scientists play a vital role in transforming data into actionable insights, and by creating efficient and user-friendly software solutions, they enable companies like Grazioso Salvare to operate more effectively, ultimately supporting their mission of rescuing and rehoming animals.
